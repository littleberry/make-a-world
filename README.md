# Let's Make a World!

A JavaScript library for a world of SVG.

This is a work in progress and is inspired by the work of Ed Emberly. You can read about the idea and goal for the work here.

This project builds a JavaScript library that creates a visual library of people, vehicles, buildings, animals, and other items for making digital worlds.
